    <p>
    Artemis, the mighty huntress, Artemis, the mighty huntress,<br />
    She hunts by the moon, She hunts by the moon,<br />
    She hunts by the light of the moon.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Artemis, the mighty huntress, Artemis, the mighty huntress,<br />
    Her eye is the eagle’s, Her rage is the lion’s,<br />
    Her embrace the fierce mother bear’s.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Hunts by the moon, Hunts by the moon,<br />
    Hunts by the light of the moon.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    In the wild places she wanders, In the deep forest she roams,<br />
    Wild creatures know her as kindred, Mysteries calling her home.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    She is our sister, (Helping bring forth new life), Our protector,<br />
    She helps us give birth and bring forth new life.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Hunts by the moon, (Artemis shine), Hunts by the moon, (Artemis shine),<br />
    Hunts by the light of the moon,<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Swiftly she runs by the river, With silver quiver and bow,<br />
    Light of the moon she will follow, Mysteries calling her home.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    She is our sister (helping girls grow to women), Our protector,<br />
    She gives us courage to be all we are.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Hunts by the moon, (Artemis shine), Hunts by the moon, (Artemis shine),<br />
    Hunts by the light of the moon, Light of the moon;<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Artemis, give us courage,<br />
    Artemis, make us stronger,<br />
    Artemis, give us daring,<br />
    Make us stronger, Give us courage,<br />
    Show your glory, Artemis.<br />

    <p>
    Demeter loved her daughter, Loved her more than life,<br />
    Bathed her in clear water, Nourished her with light,<br />
    Loving word and loving touch were all Persephone knew,<br />
    In innocent unfolding Demeter’s daughter grew.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Long and lithe and lovely as a summer flower,<br />
    Beauty in Persephone bloomed From hour into hour,<br />
    “She’s the wonder of my life, Sustains me like the sun,<br />
    She is my blessed daughter, She and I are one.”<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    (Demeter, Persephone, Persephone, Demeter)<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Safe in her mother’s keeping Persephone roamed unbound,<br />
    In the meadow by the brook the most beautiful flower she found,<br />
    “I must have this flower, I must have this bloom,<br />
    “I must have this flower, I must have this bloom...”<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    “The earth cracks open, A chariot appears,<br />
    And a man grabs me, takes me down, (takes me down),<br />
    Takes me down, (takes me down),<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Fire in his eyes burns, He says no word to me,<br />
    But his cold strong arms hold me close, (hold me close),<br />
    Hold me close, (hold me close),<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Downward into darkness he carries me, downward into darkness he carries me,<br />
    Downward into, downward into, downward into darkness he carries me on,<br />
    My sweet world gone.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Oh Mother, I’m calling you, Oh Mother hear me calling,<br />
    Oh Mother, I’m calling you, Oh Mother hear me calling,<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    I am in the underworld, Captured by Hades’ hand,<br />
    Cold and stone and darkness and a black river bound this land,<br />
    I am in the underworld, Captured by Hades’ hand,<br />
    Cold and stone and darkness and a black river bound this land,<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    And the fire that burns is not a sun, but sears like a god’s command.”
    </p>
    <p>
    How Demeter trembled when her daughter did not come,<br />
    Ran down to the meadow and wildly called her name (Persephone, Persephone),<br />
    Wind was all that answered, the sighing of the pines,<br />
    Demeter’s heart beat wildly as she called and called again.<br />
    “Daughter, I am calling you, Oh daughter, hear me calling,<br />
    “Daughter, I am calling you, Oh daughter, hear me calling,<br />
    Aah, aah, aah, aah. Aah, aah, aah, aah. ”
    </p>
    <p>
    Then a shepherd told her,<br />
    “I saw the earth crack open, I saw her fall inside,<br />
    In fear and terror I heard her cry (heard her cry), heard her cry (heard her cry),”<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Demeter screamed then, wild with her grief and pain,<br />
    Raging, she made a bitter pledge (bitter pledge), bitter pledge (bitter pledge).<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    “A curse on all beauty, A blight on all love,<br />
    Earth shall freeze and bones grow cold and the sky grow dark above.<br />
    Plants will lose their greenness, Animals die by frost,<br />
    Humans huddle in the night and pay for what I’ve lost, My daughter lost.”<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    A year the earth lay frozen, Demeter’s grief was known,<br />
    Though every god had pleaded, No living thing was grown;<br />
    Zeus the god of thunder, Humbled on his throne,<br />
    At last sent Hermes underground to bring Persephone home.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Earth returns to blooming, springtime comes again,<br />
    Human hearts find gladness in turning fertile land.<br />
    Demeter’s heart rejoices, Persephone’s spirit is free,<br />
    Mother and her daughter embracing endlessly, free, free.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Then Demeter asked her “Did you eat anything down there?”<br />
    “Only the seeds of the pomegranate fruit he gave me as he said good-bye.”<br />
    “Aah, aah, aah, aah. Aah, aah, aah, aah. ”<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Hades’ voice rang out from under the earth,<br />
    “You have eaten of my fruit, You belong to me too.<br />
    Six months with your mother in the brightsome world above,<br />
    But six months shall you comfort my heart<br />
    And solace me with your love.”<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    In the world of shadows (world of shadows) Persephone reigns as queen<br />
    And when she climbs the path to light she brings rebirth in spring,<br />
    With the changes turning, Grief and love we know,<br />
    So circles have their seasons and from the depths we grow, grow, grow.<br />

    Hera, Queen of Starry Night,<br />
    Clothed in shades of purple light,<br />
    Watching, watching from on high<br />
    With constant iridescent eye,<br />
    Perceiving all within your sight,<br />
    Hera, Queen of Starry Night.<br />

    Hera, Durga, Queen of Heaven,<br />
    Wondrous things of you are woven.<br />
    From your breasts white droplets spray<br />
    Across the sky the Milky Way,<br />
    Your overflowing milk doth yield<br />
    On earth lilies of the field,<br />
    Consort of the King of Heaven,<br />
    Hera, Durga, Queen of Heaven.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    Hera, Kali, Queen of Might,<br />
    Your mystery and power invite<br />
    Shadow forces to the light,<br />
    And, in expression, to take flight<br />
    In spirals of intoxication,<br />
    Through the fires of purification,<br />
    Burning, burning, burning bright,<br />
