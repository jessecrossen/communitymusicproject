        <b>Who:</b>
        <a href="#composer">Cynthia Crossen</a> and Hope Wilder
        (Cynthia's daughter-in-law),
        of the <a href="/">Community Music Project</a>, have assembled
        instrumentalists and a chorus of women 40-strong, to perform
        <a href="/tgs.html">The Goddess Suite</a>, with singer-songwriter
        and musical educator <a href="#conductor">Sheila Fleming</a> as conductor.
        Other acts in the program will include music, storytelling,
        and original dance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why:</b>
        We have come together to experience and share the joy of celebrating
        womanhood through song, spoken word, and dance.  To honor each
        of the seven goddesses of whom we sing, 100% of the proceeds from
        our performances will go to support local, regional, and global
        charities that embody attributes of these Greek goddesses.

        <br />
        <div>
          For <b>Hera</b>, queen of Heaven, goddess of marriage and mothering,

          <a href="http://www.llli.org/">La Leche League</a> (local and international)
          for its mission of helping mothers to bond with and nurture their babies,
          promoting breastfeeding locally and around the world.

        <br />
        <div>

        <br />
        <div>
          To honor <b>Persephone</b>, queen of the underworld, victim of

          violence and sexual assault in Chatham County, NC.

        <br />
        <div>
          For <b>Hestia</b>, goddess of the homeplace, keeper of the sacred hearth,

        <br />
        <div>

          and well-being, based on respect for each individual’s right to make
          informed, independent decisions about health, sexuality, and family planning.
        </div>
        <br />

      </ul>

      <a name="description"><h3>Description of The Goddess Suite Project</h3></a>
      <p>
        The Goddess Suite is a choral work for women's voices, with piano,
        two flutes, cello, and drum accompaniment.  Composed by Chatham
        singer-songwriter Cynthia Crossen in 1986, it was performed in
        1986 and 1987 at various venues in Chapel Hill, Durham, Raleigh,
        and Chatham County.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Goddess Suite celebrates aspects of womanhood in six choral pieces
        about seven Greek Goddesses.  Inspired by Jean Shinoda Bolen's book
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goddesses-Everywoman-Powerful-Archetypes-Womens/dp/0060572841/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272635836&sr=8-1">Goddesses in Everywoman</a>,
        it honors women's strengths by singing of
        Artemis's courage and attunement with nature, Demeter's steadfast and
        fierce motherly love, Persephone's initiation into life's challenges
        and responsibilities, the transforming power of Aphrodite's love,
        Hestia's hearth-tending and spiritual centeredness, Hera's far-seeing
        wisdom, and Athena's crusade for a better world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Goddess Suite performances celebrate women in a unique and
        inspiring way. The <a href="#composer">composer</a>,
        <a href="#conductor">conductor</a>, chorus members, and
        instrumentalists are women.  Other participating artists will share
        their unique feminine-celebratory vision.  We hope to reach a wide
        audience of women, men, and young people with these strong, vibrant,
        female archetypal “super-heroes”.  We especially want to inspire
        creativity and musical ambition in young girls, teenage girls,
        and young women. We hope that for both performers and audience,
        experiencing the Goddess Suite will be deeply moving, inspiring,
        and meaningful.
      </p>
      <!--
      <p>
        The Goddess Suite project brings the work of a deeply community-based
        composer, local musicians, and other performers to a wider community.
        We believe that this program celebrates women in a unique, moving, and
        inspiring way.  We hope to reach a wide audience of women, men, and young
        people with these strong, vibrant, female archetypal “super-heroes”.
        We especially want to inspire creativity and musical ambition in
        young girls, teenage girls, and young women.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producing this work offers women singers and musicians the opportunity
        to be part of creating and performing a deeply meaningful piece of music
        by a local composer.  It offers other artists a chance to share their
        unique feminine-celebratory vision.  We hope that for both performers
        and audience, experiencing the Goddess Suite will be deeply moving,
        inspiring, and meaningful.

      <a name="composer"><h3>Bio for Goddess Suite Composer Cynthia Rylander Crossen</h3></a>
      <p>
        Cynthia Rylander Crossen writes songs about the deepest truths she knows.
        The purpose of her music is to heal, to bring us together in love, to
        build bridges between us, to create and strengthen community, to celebrate
        and give thanks, and to remind us of our connection with the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cynthia has performed her songs since the mid-1970’s, with various musical
        friends and as part of Silkworm, Pomegranate Rose, the Earthquackers
        (environmental education musical theater for children), and currently
        with Stellaria (Cynthia, Lea Clayton, and Hope Wilder).  In 1986
        she composed, recorded, and produced six performances of The Goddess Suite,
        a choral work for women’s voices, flute, cello, and piano, about the
        Greek goddesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cynthia shares her music at coffeehouses, benefits, schools, churches,
        summer camps, environmental education festivals for the Haw and Rocky
        rivers, multiracial celebrations, old folks homes, peace rallies,
        Earth Days, women’s gatherings, hospitals, and wherever she goes.
        Her songs have been published in Songs For Earthlings by
        Julie Forest Middleton, used in a curriculum for girls, included in
        church songbooks, sung at many weddings and funerals, and performed
        by choirs in Vermont, Alaska, and locally.  For twelve years Cynthia
        led a monthly women’s singing workshop, and now offers a monthly
        musical open house with her daughter-in-law Hope Wilder.  She has
        produced numerous teaching tapes and songbooks, recorded two tapes
        with Pomegranate Rose, and is a featured artist of the
        Community Music Project.  She created the CD <a href="http://communitymusicproject.org/ftl.html">Feel This Love</a>,
        which is being distributed free as part of the Community Music Project.

        all the days of her life.  From the cornfields of Iowa, and all along
        the banks of the Mississippi, Sheila’s lyrical voice and sweet, soulful
        songs have been heard in classrooms, conferences, coffee houses, and
        concert halls throughout the Midwest.  Now living in rural Chatham
        county in North Carolina, Sheila is charming Triangle audiences with
        thoughtfully-written songs  that will capture your heart and make you
        appreciate the broad musical palette from where her music originates.

        Sheila is that rare combination of talents – a dynamic teacher,
        a superlative singer, an accomplished guitarist, and an extraordinary
        songwriter. A finalist in both the Triangle Folk Music Society’s
        Songwriting Contest (1998) and the NC Songwriters Cooperative
        Songwriters Contest (1999), she is releasing her debut solo CD
        “Circles”. Sheila currently performs with the folk/swing trio
        Trilogy in addition to her solo performances.
        She has twice been selected as Teacher of the Year in her thirteen
        years of teaching in North Carolina, and currently teaches music
        in the Chapel Hill-Carrboro School District.  Sheila also
        presents workshops and clinics to educators and musicians throughout
        North Carolina.

        Community Music Project, 1116 Marshall Road, Pittsboro, NC 27312.
        The Community Music Project is rooted in the rich, creative, and
        vibrant soil of the Carrboro/Chapel Hill/Chatham County North Carolina
        community. Its goal is to highlight the grassroots musicians of our
        own community, broadcasting the voices of our community to enrich and
        enliven the wider community, especially the talented voices that might
        otherwise not be heard—singer-songwriters who have not recorded CD’s
        on their own, gospel singers in the folk tradition, folk singers from
        Russian and South American traditions, and community choruses.  For more
        information, and to download our music and CD art, visit
